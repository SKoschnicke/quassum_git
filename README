1. create list of remote branches and save it into branches.txt

   git branch -r > branches.txt

   (see create_branch_txt.sh)

2. execute branches.rb

   ruby branches.rb

   this creates delete_closed_tickets.sh

3. execute delete_closed_tickets.sh to delete branches
   you can use ssh-agent to avoid entering your password on every branch delete:

   `ssh-agent`
   ssh-add
